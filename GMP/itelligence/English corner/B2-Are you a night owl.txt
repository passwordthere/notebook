I swear, lately it's impossible for me to get some shuteye before 3 am.

Maybe you've got insomnia, Frankie.

I'm not so sure about that, Brad. Once I'm out, my quality of sleep is great.

Well, what is it you're doing in the wee hours of the morning then?

That's how I was in college. All-nighters were a common thing for me 

Same. My creative juices just seem to flow better during the graveyard hours.

Well, if your sleep patterns aren't anxiety-induced and you get 8 hours, I'd say you're ok.

Actually, a lack of sleep is more unhealthy than going to bed late.

Really?Now I feel much better about being a night owl.
