When I woke up this morning, I found a few strands of hair on my pillow.

Yeah, you could go that route. Or, wait a minute, did you get a perm recently?

Ok, let's not freak out here, brendan. There's still a lot you can do to keep a full head of hair. Maybe you could try a hair restoration product.

Laser therapy and hair transplant surgery are popular these days.

Maybe that's it. Or maybe I've gotten too much exposure to ultraviolet rays. Why did I go to the beach last summer!

Will, I feel like my hair has been getting thinner lately.

I don't know. After all, my father is bald. Maybe my heredity is finally catching up to me.

That's nothing. The human scalp tends to lose 50 to 200 strands each day. Our hair is in a constant cycle of growth, rest and renewal.

Well, if you are going bald, genetics is just one potential factor. Constant stress and an improper diet can also trigger hair loss.
