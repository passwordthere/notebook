Starting an email with “Dear” is in my opinion somewhat unprofessional.

When you send an email to multiple recipients, you would do better to keep your salutation casual, yet professional.

For example:

“Hello team,” or “Hi colleagues,” or even “Hi all,”.

Whatever you use to start your email, you do not need to capitalize the collective term you use to address the group. You can if you want and it's doubtful anyone would take offense or think it's weird. It's just not necessary.

Any recipient you address specifically should be addressed by their name and of course you should always capitalize that.
