How to Start an Email Professionally (How to Start a Business Email)


21  Hiya    This is a very common way of saying “hello”, especially in the North of England. It is also used a lot in text messaging.
17. Heyyy   When texting or sending direct messages, some people like to add extra “y”s at the end of “hey”. For some mysterious reason, this is most often used when flirting. The longer the tail of “y”s, the flirtier the message! More than three or four looks a little bit desperate though…
26. Goodmorrow! This is a ridiculous way to say “Good morning”. It is unnecessarily formal and associated with old-fashioned poetry, so using it in real conversation is definitely pretty silly!

Starting an email with “Dear” is in my opinion somewhat unprofessional.

When you send an email to multiple recipients, you would do better to keep your salutation casual, yet professional.

For example:

“Hello team,” or “Hi colleagues,” or even “Hi all,”.

Whatever you use to start your email, you do not need to capitalize the collective term you use to address the group. You can if you want and it's doubtful anyone would take offense or think it's weird. It's just not necessary.

Any recipient you address specifically should be addressed by their name and of course you should always capitalize that.
