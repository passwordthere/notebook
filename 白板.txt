32651   Why there are still BIT signature in SNOW?  
Just copied from template

32015   Pls follow "https://bit-twiki.wdf.sap.corp/bin/view/ToolsAndHelper/Processes/HowToPrepareRepaired" and in process this internal ticket again. Before reinstall OS, check comment carefully.And why even RITM ticket was not removed in additional comment, server status is still in maintenance?
SNOW ticket once posted "can't login neither a1sroot nor support" and just rebooted iLO so that can access iLO, but I can log in with a1sroot when I handling the ticket and don't know that still need to reinstall OS.

32280   Don't paste this info "This ticket is opened with reference to already existing case 5357944527" in newly created RITM0090286 which confused DCM team. A new HW issue needs a new RITM ticket and a new vender case.
